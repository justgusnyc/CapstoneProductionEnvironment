<!-- so now we replaced the anchorpane with this border pane because it has 4-5 parts in it we can
customize, and we are customizing it with our different windows so the left stays as the menu, and the middle changes

additionally, because we removed the fx controller from this file, we need to manually add in the controller
using premade functions within the ViewFactory class section that has to do with showing the closed system window


we added a fx id to this borden pane so that we can reference it when we need to change the middle section of the border
pane when we switch scenes through the menu-->

<BorderPane fx:id="closedSystemParent" xmlns="http://javafx.com/javafx"
            xmlns:fx="http://javafx.com/fxml">

    <left>
        <fx:include source="ClosedSystemMenu.fxml"/>
    </left>

    <center>
        <fx:include source="Dashboard.fxml"/>
    </center>


</BorderPane>
